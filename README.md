# Ball-Handle-Software
This repo includes the software for my master thesis project to invent a future ball handle system for the soccer robots of the MSL-team Carpe Noctem Cassel at RoboCup.

Now its being developed and not ready.
Short to the basics:
  - closed-loop-system 
  - pixycam as vision for ball tracking 
  - servos to change the direction of the ball-handle-wheels
  - imu to get robots motion 
  - estimate ball und robot motion state with kalman-filter 
  
The detailed documentation with analysis of the ball movement and realization of the concept follows in my master thesis.
